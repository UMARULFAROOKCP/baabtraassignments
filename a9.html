<h2 id="cmp">COMPUTER</h2>
<a href="#top"> <h5> GO TO TOP </h5> </a>


<p>
	A computer is general purpose device that can be programmed to carry out a set of arithmetic and logic operations. since a sequence of operations can be readily changed, the computer can solve more than one kind of problem.
</p>
<h5 id="cpu">cpu</h5>
<p>
	CPU (pronounced as separate letters) is the abbreviation for central processing unit. Sometimes referred to simply as the central processor, but more commonly called processor, the CPU is the brains of the computer where most calculations take place.
</p>
<h5 id="alu">ALU</h5>
<p>
	An arithmetic logic unit (ALU) is a digital circuit used to perform arithmetic and logic operations. It represents the fundamental building block of the central processing unit (CPU) of a computer. Modern CPUs contain very powerful and complex ALUs.
</p>

<h2 id="pl"> PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES</h2>
<a href="#top"> <h5> GO TO TOP </h5> </a>

<p>
	A programming language is a formal language that specifies a set of instructions that can be used to produce various kinds of output. Programming languages generally consist of instructions for a computer. Programming languages can be used to create programs that implement specific algorithms.
</p>
<h4 id="c">c</h4>
<p>
	C (as in the letter c) is a general-purpose, imperative computer programming language, supporting structured programming, lexical variable scope and recursion, while a static type system prevents many unintended operations.
</p>
<h4 id="cpp">c<sup>++</sup></h4>
<p>
	C++, pronounced "C plus plus," is a programming language that was built off the C language. The syntax of C++ is nearly identical to C, but it has object-oriented features, which allow the programmer to create objects within the code.
</p>
<h2 id="dbms">DBMS</h2>
<a href="#top"> <h5> GO TO TOP </h5> </a>
<p>
	A database management system (DBMS) is a computer software application that interacts with the user, other applications, and the database itself to capture and analyze data.
</p>
<h4 id="rdbms">RDBMS</h4>
<p>
	RDBMS is the basis for SQL, and for all modern database systems like MS SQL Server, IBM DB2, Oracle, MySQL, and Microsoft Access. A Relational database management system (RDBMS) is a database management system (DBMS) that is based on the relational model as introduced by E. F. Codd.
</p>
<h4 id="oodbms">OODBMS</h4>
<p>
	An object-oriented database management system (OODBMS) is a database management system that supports the creation and modeling of data as objects. OODBMS also includes support for classes of objects and the inheritance of class properties, and incorporates methods, subclasses and their objects.
